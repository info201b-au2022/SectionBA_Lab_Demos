## This is the server file where 
## you will respond to user events and changes do something based on input
## and what will be produced and running everytime and responding to changes. etc..

## first start by setting up the libraries which you might need for plots or handling events

## Load the dplyr library



## Load the shiny library

## load the ggplot2 library


## load the maps library



##load the mapproj library


## source the Lab_Demo_ui.R


## load the plotly library

## Load the starbucks dataset Data/StarbucksData.csv" into a varible called `starbucks`


## The first set up you should do is set up a variable `Demo_server` and create a function
## by passing it an input and output. This would allow you to recieve input from users
## or other places and the output would server as what will be returned from the 
## server and shown to the user and be displayed in the ui. Its very important you 
## name the server Demo_server so it can be used later on in the app and it knows about.


##1. Inside the server do the following create an output to render a ggplot. Name this
## starbucks_output

## 2. Render a renderPlotly for your plot. By calling renderPlot function()

## 3. Inside the renderPlot Change the columns in the starbucks data to be the following
## "Food", "Calories", "Fat (g)", "Carb (g)", "Fiber (g)", "Protein (g)"


## 4. Store your plot in a starbucks `starbucks_plot`. 

## 5. Create a ggplot with the data being `starbucks` with a geom_line

## 6.  set the x axis to be the string `Calories` and the y axis to be the user input 
## this is based on the UI input$nutrition_type. Hint use double 
## brackets. Set the color of the plot to be the choice
## the user makes which is input$color_input


## 7. Call your starbucks plot at the end.

##Optionally set labs for ggtitle
