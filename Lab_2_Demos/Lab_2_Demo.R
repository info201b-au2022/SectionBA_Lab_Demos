# For each question/prompt, write the necessary code to calculate the answer.
# For grading, it's important that you store your answers in the variable names
# listed with each question in `backtics`.
# For each prompt marked `Reflection`, please write a response
# in your `README.md` file.


## Querstion 0: Warmup What is the max of these numbers 10, 40, 50, 100, 400, 135, 70 `max_total`


# Question 1. # Load the `stringr` package, which you'll use later.



# Question 2: Load the data from Starbucks Data 
# into a variable called `starbucks` rember to store strings AS factors as a false




## Question 3: How much  rows are in  the dataset 'num_starbucks'




## Question 4: Extract the `Calories` column into a variable called `num_calories`





## Question 5: What is the mean number of Calories? `mean_calories` 
##(hint for this and other calculations: you'll need to consider missing values)





# Reflection 1: View your data and Create an unordered list of what you like about the starbucks datatset.
## And found intersting





## Question 6: Write a function which would return Any name when passed into one value 
## like a first and last name. Your functiuon will be passed a 
#first and last name. So if passed for example James Hopkins the function should return 
## JamesHopkins NO SPACES as one word. Store this in a varible `no_spaces`




## Question 7: call your function above and pass it the first_name as Mo and the last name as hamed store this in a
## variable store this in a variable student_name . The student_name should contain the name "Mohamed"






##Question 8: Write a function which would return a word with
## the first name and last name plus the 
## sentence Is the weiredest name I seen sperated by a _ with spaces to show it.
## Your function would be passed a first_name and last_name. So for example if your passed a first name Fist 
## and last name Wall your function should 
## return Fist_Wall_Is  the weirdest name I heard Where Fist is the first name
## and Wall is the last name
## store this in a variable with_underscores.





## Reflection 2: #Type a pargraph with at least a bold explaining why you find the datatset intersting




##Question 9:
##Call your function with_dashes. and pass it the arguments 
## of the starbucks dataset of the 11th entry as the first name 
## and 30th entry of the X column as the last name as the second argument
## store this in a variable yea_dashes




## Question 10: Create a vector of some of the things you might find in a store. 'find_in_store`






## Question 11: Write a program which would replace all the strings in find_in_store vector with just no
## No. 'no_vector` SO for example when you run your no vector it should return the value only no a one element vector.
## user: notice - You may get a warning in the console hint this is expected.
